# Kaggle-learning
The storage inventory storage code when I learn, I learn knowledge is very shallow, if lucky to be anyone to search, welcome to guide, I will be open-minded to ask, thank you
This is my machine learning, in order to deepen the impression of learning, in kaggle to find the project for practical engineering projects. The data used in this project is a very common digital recognizer data set, which is known as the Hello world in machine learning. I use machine learning SVM algorithm, the accuracy is 98.282, the accuracy is very low. This item is only my collection for commemorative use, welcome professional guidance, I am very grateful.
